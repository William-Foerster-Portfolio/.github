# GitHub Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This repository showcases various projects that I have worked on, demonstrating my technical skills. Below, I've included an overview of my background, key skills, and links to individual project repositories.

## About Me

### AboutAbout
Driven to perform at the highest level, I have devoted myself to developing the skills necessary to learn rapidly, adapt, and problem-solve. While working on numerous projects for my Electrical and Computer Engineering degree, my adaptability allowed me to successfully develop projects by designing and implementing embedded software, RTOS software, PCBs, hardware, databases, and machine learning models.

While my technical skills allow me to be an effective individual engineer, my leadership and communication skills have also allowed me to successfully lead team-based projects and manage 40+ employees in a supervisory role.

After developing a diverse technical background, I am currently seeking machine learning/AI, computer, and software engineering positions where I can continue improving my technical and leadership skills to be a valuable and effective engineer.
